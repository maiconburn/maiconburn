I am a software developer with a background in marketing, holding a degree from Unopar - University of Northern Paran√°, and an MSc in Entrepreneurship from Falmouth University. My technical training in software development has allowed me to contribute to projects for renowned Brazilian brands such as BOX1824, Agency Yo, GAD, AG2, MJV, and CUBOCC, among others.

As a 2nd Dan Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do, I've competed in two Brazilian National Championships and the British National Championship in 2021, where I secured third place. Additionally, I've taught classes to children and teens for seven years. This experience has honed my leadership skills and instilled values like humility, perseverance, respect, altruism, and self-control, which I carry into my professional life.

I'm a founding member of two companies: Invalley Innovation and Design, where we innovate through the design and development of products, services, and strategies to improve lives; and Adeus Rotina, a unique monthly subscription service delivering romantic or intimate experiences for couples. I oversee the technology operations in both companies and contribute to developing our digital products.

I'm passionate about using technology to serve humanity, and the most rewarding work one can do is to create a positive impact on individual lives and society. I have devoted time to volunteering with organizations like Sonhar Acordado, Junior Achievement, and Junior Chamber International, working towards this goal.

On GitHub, you'll find my contributions to various projects, showcasing my skills in software development. I'm always eager to collaborate on new projects and learn from other developers in the community. My profile conveys my passion for technology and commitment to using my skills to improve the world.
